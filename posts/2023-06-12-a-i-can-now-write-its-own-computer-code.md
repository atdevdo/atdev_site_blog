As soon as Tom Smith got his hands on Codex — a new artificial intelligence technology that writes its own computer programs — he gave it a job interview.

He asked if it could tackle the “coding challenges” that programmers often face when interviewing for big-money jobs at Silicon Valley companies like Google and Facebook. Could it write a program that replaces all the spaces in a sentence with dashes? Even better, could it write one that identifies invalid ZIP codes?

It did both instantly, before completing several other tasks. “These are problems that would be tough for a lot of humans to solve, myself included, and it would type out the response in two seconds,” said Mr. Smith, a seasoned programmer who oversees an A.I. start-up called Gado Images. “It was spooky to watch.”

Codex seemed like a technology that would soon replace human workers. As Mr. Smith continued testing the system, he realized that its skills extended well beyond a knack for answering canned interview questions. It could even translate from one programming language to another.

Yet after several weeks working with this new technology, Mr. Smith believes it poses no threat to professional coders. In fact, like many other experts, he sees it as a tool that will end up boosting human productivity. It may even help a whole new generation of people learn the art of computers, by showing them how to write simple pieces of code, almost like a personal tutor.

“This is a tool that can make a coder’s life a lot easier,” Mr. Smith said.

Codex, built by OpenAI, [one of the world’s most ambitious research labs](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/technology/open-ai-microsoft.html), provides insight into the state of artificial intelligence. Though a wide range of A.I. technologies have improved by leaps and bounds over the past decade, even the most impressive systems have ended up complementing human workers rather than replacing them.

## A New Generation of Chatbots

Card 1 of 5

**A brave new world.** A new crop of chatbots powered by artificial intelligence has ignited a scramble to determine whether the technology [could upend the economics of the internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/technology/chatbots-disrupt-internet-industry.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-artificial-intelligence&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc), turning today’s powerhouses into has-beens and creating the industry’s next giants. Here are the bots to know:

**ChatGPT.** ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence language model from a research lab, OpenAI, has been making headlines since November for its ability to respond to complex questions, write poetry, generate code, [plan vacations](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/travel/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-travel-vacation.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-artificial-intelligence&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc) and translate languages. GPT-4, the latest version introduced in mid-March, [can even respond to images](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/technology/openai-new-gpt4.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-artificial-intelligence&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc) (and ace the Uniform Bar Exam).

**Bing.** Two months after ChatGPT’s debut, Microsoft, OpenAI’s primary investor and partner, [added a similar chatbot](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/microsoft-ai-chatgpt-bing.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-artificial-intelligence&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc), capable of having open-ended text conversations on virtually any topic, to its Bing internet search engine. But it was the bot’s occasionally inaccurate, misleading and [weird responses](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-artificial-intelligence&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc) that drew much of the attention after its release.

**Bard.** Google’s chatbot, called Bard, [was released in March](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/technology/google-bard-chatbot.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-artificial-intelligence&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc) to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain. Originally conceived as a creative tool designed to draft emails and poems, it can generate ideas, write blog posts and [answer questions with facts or opinions](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/technology/google-bard-guide-test.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-artificial-intelligence&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc).

**Ernie.** The search giant Baidu unveiled China’s first major rival to ChatGPT in March. The debut of Ernie, short for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, [turned out to be a flop](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/world/asia/china-baidu-chatgpt-ernie.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-artificial-intelligence&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc) after a promised “live” demonstration of the bot was revealed to have been recorded.

Thanks to the rapid rise of a mathematical system called a [neural network](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/technology/google-artificial-intelligence.html), machines can now learn certain skills by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for example, they can learn to recognize a cat.

This is the technology that [recognizes the commands you speak into your iPhone](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/17/technology/alexa-siri-conversation.html), [translates between languages on services like Skype](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html) and [identifies pedestrians and street signs as self-driving cars speed down the road](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/tesla-full-self-driving-fsd.html).

About four years ago, researchers at labs like OpenAI started designing neural networks that [analyzed enormous amounts of prose](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/technology/artificial-intelligence-language.html), including thousands of digital books, Wikipedia articles and all sorts of other text posted to the internet.

By pinpointing patterns in all that text, the networks learned to predict the next word in a sequence. When someone typed a few words into these “[universal language models](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-gpt3.html),” they could complete the thought with entire paragraphs. In this way, one system — an OpenAI creation called GPT-3 — could write its own Twitter posts, speeches, poetry and news articles.

Much to the surprise of even the researchers who built the system, it could even write its own computer programs, though they were short and simple. Apparently, it had learned from an untold number of programs posted to the internet. So OpenAI went a step further, training a new system — Codex — on an enormous array of both prose and code.
