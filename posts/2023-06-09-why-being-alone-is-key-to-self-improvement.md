However, the two are very different aspects of the same physical manifestation.

Solitude is, by definition, being alone, whereas [loneliness](https://everydaypower.com/how-to-deal-with-loneliness/) is a negative emotional response to solitude.

Being alone is innately uncomfortable.

As humans, we are most comfortable in the presence of others.

## **Why do humans dislike being alone?**

This primordial response goes back to the Dark Ages when living in groups provided safety and security.

In modern times, we no longer need this social community to survive – yet it is still ingrained in our subconscious.

We all value love and connection with others.

This need for social interaction and belonging is still an important part of our well-being.

Social interaction can:

-   Lead to better mental health
-   Lower your risk of dementia
-   Make us feel safe
-   Give you a network of people to confide in

To inspire individual thought and introspection, one needs to cleave from this paradigm and free up the mental space necessary to focus on the bigger picture and long-term goals.

For this moment, *it’s okay to forget about the needs of others*.

> ## **_Being alone doesn’t mean being lonely._**

The two are not mutually exclusive.

Believe it or not, [loneliness provides a conduit to self-reflection](https://everydaypower.com/loneliness-into-self-reflection/) and enlightenment.

Attaining solitude can help you contemplate your own beliefs and ideas rather than being influenced by the opinions of others.

This is invaluable in the quest for self-belief and confidence.

Self-reflection can be the most important emotional release allowing self-validation and securing your own identity.

It can also bolster your aspirations and set aside negativity, going a long way to [balancing your life](https://everydaypower.com/balance-finding-your-happy-medium-in-life/).

According to *Reed Larson*, a Professor of Human Development and Family Studies at the University of Illinois, who has studied the effects of solitude on development and long-term well-being in teens and adolescents, being alone – although NOT particularly enjoyed – creates [positive emotions](https://everydaypower.com/10-ways-to-trigger-positive-emotions/) and less self-reported depression.
