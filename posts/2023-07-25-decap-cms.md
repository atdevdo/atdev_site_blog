# Add to Your Site

You can adapt Decap CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). You can also create your own custom backend.

This tutorial guides you through the steps for adding Decap CMS to a site that's built with a common [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/), like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can [start from a template](https://decapcms.org/docs/start-with-a-template) or dive right into [configuration options](https://decapcms.org/docs/configuration-options).

## App File Structure

A static `admin` folder contains all Decap CMS files, stored at the root of your published site. Where you store this folder in the source files depends on your static site generator. Here's the static file location for a few of the most popular static site generators:

If your generator isn't listed here, you can check its documentation, or as a shortcut, look in your project for a `css` or `images` folder. The contents of folders like that are usually processed as static files, so it's likely you can store your `admin` folder next to those. (When you've found the location, feel free to add it to these docs by [filing a pull request](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)!)
