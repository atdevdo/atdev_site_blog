**A trial under way at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary is exploring whether artificial intelligence (AI) can assist radiologists in reviewing thousands of mammograms a year.**

The pilot helped spot early-stage breast cancer for June - a healthcare assistant and participant in the trial - and she is now set to undergo surgery as a result.

Mammograms are low level X-rays used in breast cancer screenings to monitor and detect changes too small to see or feel.

[According to the NHS,](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-screening-mammogram/how-to-decide-if-you-want-breast-screening/) they help save about 1,300 lives each year in the UK.

And while the number of women who attended a routine breast screening, after an invitation, [increased in Scotland](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/publications/scottish-breast-screening-programme-statistics/scottish-breast-screening-programme-statistics-annual-update-to-31-march-2022/) in the three-year period to 2022, the number of radiologists to review results is shrinking.

## What is AI?

AI - technology which sees computers perform specific tasks that would typically require human intelligence - is already widely used across a range of industries.

[While high-profile experts' fears](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65746524) that AI could lead to the extinction of humanity have recently been making headlines, the tech's more practical realities are already being shown in healthcare.

Its potential to speed up the process of drug and disease discovery means many scientists and doctors see AI as a powerful tool to work with, rather than replace, practitioners.

AI radiology in breast cancer screenings is being trialled at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary

The number of screen-detected breast cancers of women of all ages grew to 1,830 between 2021 and 2022 in Scotland, according to Public Health Scotland (PHS) data.

Of the 5,000 mammograms scrutinised on average by radiologists each year, between 250 and 300 patients will be called back - with 30 to 40 of them requiring closer attention.

"There is a chance that with that number, you could miss cancers," Dr Gerald Lip, clinical director of the North East Scotland Breast Screening Programme, told BBC Click.

[NHS Grampian's Gemini project](https://www.nhsgrampian.org/about-us/innovation-hub/projects/gemini/) - a collaboration between the NHS, the University of Aberdeen and private industry - was mentioned in Scotland's AI Strategy when it launched in 2021.

Kheiron Medical Technologies developed the AI model Mia, used in the trial, with Microsoft providing the cloud computing services to support it.

With rules set by the National Screening Counsel currently forbidding the automatic deployment of AI in screenings, Dr Lip and other radiologists are trialling it as an additional check at the end of mammogram scan reviews.

June, a participant in the trial who has undergone similar surgery before, received a biopsy to remove a small part of her breast tissue for testing after Dr Lip explained how the AI tool helped identify an area of concern.
