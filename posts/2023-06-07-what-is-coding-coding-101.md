_Coding runs the world as we know it_, but **the vast majority of people aren’t even aware of its existence**, let alone what it even is, despite the fact that **coding is vital for most of the contemporary businesses**. That's why those who choose to **learn to code** (_whether with [one online course](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/introduction-to-python-programming-udemy), [or another](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/edx-homepage)_) are in high demand for employers.

Before we start digging deeper, I want you to **try to answer "What is Coding?" for yourself...**

Now, **right-click somewhere inside your browser window**, and select ‘**View Page Source**’. Scroll through the window that pops up and see if you recognize or understand anything.

As you may have expected, you were just **viewing the code behind this webpage**, or the **[document object model ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)**(DOM). That means, that you see the full markup of the page and if you have learned at least the basics **[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) or [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)**, it might be easier to spot some familiar tags and elements.

Now, in simple terms, l*et’s define coding as the basic act of writing* – in a programming language – **a script that a computer can understand**. This script will tell the computer **to behave in a certain way**, to do a certain thing, and to, ultimately, **perform the actions that you want it to** – *if your code is right*.

## Code As a ‘Translator’

<!--StartFragment-->

What is coding? While we have defined coding as **the act of writing a script in a language that your computer can understand**, let’s get down and dirty and have a look at some coding background.

**Computers don't understand human language** and in order for us to see some results (like displaying a web page), we have to **write it in a way that the computer would understand.**

**_Coding 101_** - *Think of your code as a translator between English (or whatever language you speak) and Binary. If you can do this, it will suddenly become much easier to grasp the basics of what is coding.*

So, think about it this way: your machine **only really speaks Binary**, but it understands **different coding languages**. In the same way, *you only really speak your native language,* but you understand the same coding languages (if you at least have the basics of some, of course).

The fact that **both you and your computer share a common understanding of programming languages means that you can communicate with each other** - just like you did when you clicked to come to this article!

## Why Should I Learn Coding?

Now that we have touched on *the basics of coding,* it’s time to take a look at a few of the reasons **why you should think seriously about learning to code**.

Coding can have huge impacts on both your **personal and your professional life**. Some of the major reasons why everyone should learn to code or at least understand what is coding:

-   **It will increase your earning potential massively -** Experienced coders and programmers can **charge extremely high hourly rates**, especially if they are working as freelance or contract developers.\
    \
    Many coders **won’t work for less than $100 per hour**, which will give you an income to live up to all your wildest dreams. And the best thing? The fact that there is a shortage of coders out there means that people will happily pay you ridiculous amounts, *especially once you have some experience*.
-   **You could work for yourself -** While many people who understand what is coding hold down **traditional contracts at large companies**, a huge percentage choose to **work in freelance roles**.\
    \
    As a freelance coder, you will have **the ability to work where you want to,** **when you want to, and how you want to**. In reality, there is so much work out there for coders that you will be able to only work on projects that you enjoy.
-   **You can work on your projects -** If you have an entrepreneurial streak, then learning how to code could be the trigger that results in you **developing the next viral app or website.** Knowing to go out there and create things that before you could only have dreamed of is a wonderful thing - believe me!

These are just a few of the reasons **why you should learn to code** and not only know what is coding. Doing so will also ensure that you are never out of work, that you will have the ability to understand the technology and the world around you as it develops, and that you will be able to say no to uninteresting job offers.

Don’t believe me? Get out there and have a **[go at coding 101 or learning coding basics](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/)** today. *What do you have to lose?*
