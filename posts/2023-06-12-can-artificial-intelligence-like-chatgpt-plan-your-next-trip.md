If you are a traveler, you really must give AI (artificial intelligence) a shot at planning your next trip. It’s so easy. I’ll give step by step instructions at the end of this article. Don’t expect it to make reservations for you, or to give you turn by turn directions, but it will definitely help you get started with bringing your travel ideas to life.

We are thinking about taking an RV trip to the Northeast this fall and see the famous fall colors.

## I asked ChatGPT:

“I want to travel to New England and the Canadian maritime provinces this fall to see the sights and the fall colors. Can you plan an itinerary for me? I will be traveling in an RV and want to stay in campgrounds. The trip should start on September 12 in Boston and end on October 2 in Ship Bottom New Jersey.”

> ## ChatGPT Responded:
>
> Sure, I’d be happy to help plan an itinerary for your New England and Canadian maritime trip! Here’s a rough outline:
>
> Day 1-2: Boston, Massachusetts
>
> -   Start your trip in Boston and spend a couple of days exploring the city’s historic sites, museums, and delicious seafood restaurants.
>
> Day 3: Salem, Massachusetts
>
> -   Drive up to Salem, a historic seaside town famous for its witch trials and spooky atmosphere.
>
> Day 4: Portland, Maine
>
> -   Head north to Portland, Maine, a charming coastal town known for its lobster and lighthouses.
>
> Day 5: Acadia National Park, Maine
>
> -   Drive up to Acadia National Park, one of the most beautiful national parks in the country, and enjoy the breathtaking fall foliage.
>
> Day 6-7: Bar Harbor, Maine
>
> -   Stay in the picturesque town of Bar Harbor, Maine, which serves as a gateway to Acadia National Park.
>
> Day 8-9: St. Andrews, New Brunswick
>
> -   Cross the border into Canada and visit St. Andrews, a quaint town on the Bay of Fundy known for its charming architecture and whale watching tours.
>
> Day 10-11: Fundy National Park, New Brunswick
>
> -   Head to Fundy National Park, where you can see the world’s highest tides and hike through the beautiful forested landscape.

## That’s not good enough

It continued like this thru Day 22, but notice that it did not include campgrounds for our overnight stays. Here is where we all need to learn how to talk to AI chatbots. It’s not like our past experiences with computer queries, where you only get one result. Talking to AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, or Bard, is more like talking to a person. Imaging asking a friend to tell you about their vacation and they responded with “I went to Hawaii for 10 days.” You wouldn’t leave it at that, you’d ask a follow up like, “Give me details, who did you go with, what did you see?”

It’s the same with AI. So I continued the conversation with ChatGPT:

I asked ChatGPT:

Please suggest campgrounds for each night
