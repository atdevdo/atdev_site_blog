On a cloudy Christmas morning last year, a rocket carrying the most powerful space telescope ever built blasted off from a launchpad in French Guiana. After reaching its destination in space about a month later, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) began sending back sparkling presents to humanity—jaw-dropping images that are revealing our universe in stunning new ways.

Every year since 1988, *Popular Science* has highlighted the innovations that make living on Earth even a tiny bit better. And this year—our 35th—has been remarkable, thanks to the successful deployment of the JWST, which earned our highest honor as the Innovation of the Year. But it’s just one item out of the 100 stellar technological accomplishments our editors have selected to recognize.

The list below represents months of research, testing, discussion, and debate. It celebrates exciting inventions that are improving our lives in ways both big and small. These technologies and discoveries are teaching us about the nature of the universe and treating diseases, but they’re also giving us better ways of entertaining and expressing ourselves.

With 10 categories spanning from aerospace to sports and outdoors, the list is a doozy. We’ve got Naval fighter jets on the big screen and TikTok filters on your phone. There’s gear to help you explore the great outdoors, and devices to help you improve your health and home. We’ve got gadgets galore, a very long suspension bridge, and an EV with a range of 747 miles. So buckle up, and explore the winners below.

[In space, no one can hear a probe]() smash into an asteroid—but that’s just what happened in September, when NASA’s successful DART experiment proved that it’s possible to reroute a space rock by crashing into it on purpose. And that wasn’t even the most important event to materialize in space this year—more on the JWST in a moment. Back on Earth, innovation also reached new heights in the aviation industry, as a unique electric airplane took off, as did a Black Hawk helicopter that can fly itself.

## The James Webb Space Telescope by NASA: A game-changing new instrument to see the cosmos

Once a generation, an astronomical tool arrives that surpasses everything that came before it. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is just such a creation. After more than two decades and $9.7 billion in the making, JWST [launched on December 25, 2021](https://www.popsci.com/space/james-webb-space-telescope-launch/). Since [February](https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/02/11/photons-received-webb-sees-its-first-star-18-times/) of this year, when it first started imaging—employing a mirror and aperture nearly three times larger in radius than its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope—JWST’s [vibrant images](https://www.popsci.com/science/james-webb-space-telescope-x-ray/) have captured the attention of the world.

The JWST can see deep into fields of [forming stars](https://www.nasa.gov/webbfirstimages). It can peer 13 billion years back in time at [ancient galaxies](https://www.popsci.com/science/big-bang-galaxy-formation-james-webb-space-telescope/), still in their nursery. It can peek at [exoplanets](https://www.popsci.com/science/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-image/), seeing them directly where astronomers would have once had to reconstruct meager traces of their existence. It can teach us about how [those stars](https://www.popsci.com/science/jwst-protostar/) and [galaxies](https://www.popsci.com/science/james-webb-space-telescope-dwarf-galaxy/) came together from primordial matter, something [Hubble could only glimpse](https://www.popsci.com/science/pillars-of-creations-space-telescope/).

While Hubble circles in low Earth orbit, JWST instead sits hundreds of thousands of miles farther away, in Earth’s shadow. It will never see sunlight. There, protected even further by a multi-layer sunshield thinner than a human fingernail, the telescope chills at -370 degrees F, where JWST’s [infrared sight](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/nircam.html) works best. Its home is a fascinating location called L2, one of several points where the sun and Earth’s gravities balance each other out.
