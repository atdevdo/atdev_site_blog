Growth mindset refers to our core belief that our talents can be developed through practice, which may influence our thoughts and behaviors. Growth mindset has been studied in a variety of fields, including education, sports, and management. However, few studies have explored whether differences in individuals’ growth mindsets influence college students’ self-reported mental health. Using the Growth Mindset Scale, Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist, and SCL-90 Scale, data was collected from 2,505 freshmen in a University in China. Findings revealed that the students within the growth mindset group scored significantly lower on “mental health issues” and “stress due to life events” than the students in the fixed mindset group. Our findings suggest that individuals with a growth mindset are less prone to mental health problems than individuals with a fixed mindset.

## Introduction

### Current Status of Mental Health

Approximately 13.4% of adolescents suffer from mental health issues worldwide ([Polanczyk et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref42)). Findings from a nationwide epidemiological study in China found that the prevalence of depression and anxiety among college students was 11.7% ([Chen et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref8)), and 16.3% ([Wu et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref60)) respectively. Mood disorders are also common in China ([Hardeveld et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref25); [Gitlin and Miklowitz, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref21)). The prevalence of mental disorders in China has continuously risen over the past 30 years ([Huang et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref29)). According to the statistics reported by the World Health Organization, the total number of people afflicted with depression worldwide is approximately 350 million, and the percentage of people globally suffering from depression is estimated at 4.4% ([Smith, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref50); [Liu et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref33)). These statistics are also inclusive of children, with depression estimated to be the largest contributor of global burden of adolescent disease worldwide ([Zheng and Zheng, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref69); [Saxena and Kline, 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref45)). Poor interpersonal skills, poor grades, and lower graduation rates have been linked to mental health issues and suicidal behavior in college students ([Tang et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref53)).

Gender variables may also play a large role in mental health and wellbeing. A recent study demonstrated that gender was a major contributing factor to one’s self-rated health and functional wellbeing. Gender differences have also been demonstrated in physical and psychological functioning discrepancies along with many other health-related variables ([Lorant et al., 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref34); [Gyasi and Phillips, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref23)). Additionally, one’s socioeconomic status (SES) can have a large impact on mental health ([Wagstaff and Doorslaer, 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref55)). The role of SES in the differential prevalence of depression is strongly supported by a large body of empirical evidence. That is, individuals who perceive themselves as having a low SES, are more susceptible to experiencing depressive symptoms ([Sánchez-Moreno and Gallardo-Peralta, 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref44); [MacCarthy et al., 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref35)).

### Growth Mindset

The belief that one has the capacity to grow is known as a growth mindset. Growth mindset, or attributes that are malleable, encourage healthy and adaptive ways of facing and tolerating anxiety, frustration, and disappointment, which promotes resilience ([Schroder, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref47)). Growth mindset may make individuals more resilient and persistent in the face of challenges or difficulties, as they are more likely to adopt effort-oriented strategies in their efforts to achieve their goals ([Zhao et al., 2021a](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref66)). People with a growth mindset may suffer fewer stress and self-reported symptoms of psychological disease. For instance, when adolescents experience family stress, growth mindset can relieve the stress and reduce the protective effects of externalizing behaviors ([Walker and Jiang, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref56)). On the other hand, fixed mindset (entity theories of personality) have been shown to predict greater self-reported stress ([Yeager et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref62)) and anxiety following ostracism, as well as greater reports of psychosocial stress and psychopathology ([Schleider et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref46); [Miu and Yeager, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref38)) compared to a growth mindset (incremental theories of personality; [Yeager et al., 2016a](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref63)). Entity theories of personality are associated with negative self-conscious emotions, such as shame ([Yeager et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref64)). Furthermore, findings from a meta-analysis study demonstrated a negative correlation between growth mindset and psychological distress (*r* = −0.220), a positive correlation between growth mindset and treatment value (*r* = 0.137), and a positive correlation between growth mindset and positive coping (*r* = 0.207; [Burnette et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref4)). While the impact of these findings were small, they support the notion that growth mindset was associated with psychological distress, treatment value, and positive coping.

Growth mindset refers to our core belief that our talents can be developed through practice, which may subsequently influence our thoughts and behaviors ([Dweck, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref17)). Mindset can affect one’s motivation, which in turn can affect academic resilience and performance. Both grit ([Duckworth et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref15); [Strayhorn, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref51)) and mindset ([Claro et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref10); [Mccutchen et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref37); [Wang et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref58); [Sun et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref52)) are linked to academic achievement, subjective wellbeing of the individual and the reduction of psychopathology ([Clark and Malecki, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref9)). A substantial body of research has shown that the belief that one’s abilities and talents can be developed (growth mindset), rather than fixed, can stimulate long-term learning. In terms of behavioral outcomes, growth mindset stimulates persistence in the face of obstacles and challenge-seeking behaviors and positively influences academic performance in primary, secondary, and higher education ([Burnette et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref5); [Jia et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref30)). Specifically, growth mindset is significantly and positively correlated with academic performance ([Wang et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref58)) and predicts higher academic achievement than fixed mindset ([Grant and Dweck, 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref22); [Blackwell et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref3)). Moreover, a range of motivational factors, such as growth mindset, has been proven to positively affect individual performance such as mental rotation performance ([Moè, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref40)). However, growth mindset and grit are not always conducive to academic achievement ([Bazelais et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref1)). It is important to be cautious when drawing conclusions about the impact of growth mindset. But the effectiveness of growth mindset on academic performance cannot be ignored.

Additionally, growth mindset describes a type of mindset an individual may possess that describes their underlying beliefs about their ability to learn and their own intelligence ([Dweck, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref17)). For instance, if a student who has a growth mindset receives a poor grade on a test, they would likely put additional effort into studying for the next test, due to their core beliefs that they are able to grow, learn, and perform better. Thus, children with a growth mindset believe that they can develop their abilities through hard work, good strategies, and guidance from others ([Blackwell et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref3); [Haimovitz and Dweck, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref24)). Having a growth mindset may also benefit individuals in a variety of different careers and educational fields, as it will allow them to persevere in the face of rejection and/or failure. In the 1980s, Dweck et al. developed a theory of implicit intelligence. They suggested that individuals would choose different achievement goals based on their own core beliefs, which would subsequently result in corresponding psychological and behavioral tendencies. These core beliefs were described in terms of having a growth mindset or a fixed mindset. That is, where individuals with a growth mindset will embrace challenges, constructive criticism, and will persevere in the face of setbacks, and individual with a fixed mind set will exhibit the opposite. Individuals with fixed mindset are more afraid of failure and mistakes. Thus, they will choose to avoid challenges which may result in failure, and will mistakenly attribute the failure to their incompetence, believing that only those who are not smart need to work hard.

### Benefits of Growth Mindset

Earlier studies in elementary and secondary schools have shown that a growth mindset is linked to better academic outcomes and lower levels of stress ([Dweck, 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref16); [Rattan et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref43); [Dweck and Yeager, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref20)). Having a growth mindset has been demonstrated to be positively correlated with learning engagement and negatively correlated with perceived COVID-19 event intensity and stress ([Zhao et al., 2021b](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref67)). Furthermore, a positive correlation exists between the mindset of teachers and the appraisal of achievement for students who demonstrate increasing marks ([De Kraker-Pauw et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref11)). Moreover, students from lower-income families are less likely to maintain a growth mindset compared to their wealthier peers. However, the students who were able to maintain a growth-mindset were much more successful in overcoming the adverse effects of poverty on their academic achievement, then those who exhibited a fixed-mindset ([Claro et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref10)). The link between growth-mindset and academic performance may be explained by students’ behaviors such as learning strategies and learning habits ([Lewis et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref32)). In a study investigating the effects of growth mindset on navigation ability, a unique portion of variance in self-reported navigation ability was found, suggesting that a growth mindset can encourage people to seek out navigation challenges and train themselves to be better navigators in daily life ([He and Hegarty, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref27)). Additionally, research on the relationship between growth mindset and obesity in adolescents has demonstrated that those with a growth mindset are more likely to be successful at losing weight ([Orvidas et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref41)).

A positive correlation has been found between growth mindset and self-efficacy for health behaviors ([Orvidas et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref41)) and perceived control ([Doron et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref14)), such that individuals who possess a growth mindset are more likely to take control of their own health. Cognitive neuroscience approaches have been used to explore the mechanisms involved in mindset patterns, errors, and adjustments ([Puusepp, 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref901)). Resilience has also been found to be related to improved attention to errors; that is, individuals with a growth mindset find it easier to bounce back from failures than individuals with a fixed mindset ([Schroder et al., 2017b](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref49)). Further, subtle feedback and information related to growth mindset could have a significant positive effect on students’ attitudes and motivation.

### The SCL-90 and ASLEC Applications

The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90) and Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC) are self-report tools commonly used to measure clinical psychiatric symptoms and mental health status ([Derogatis, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref12)). The SCL-90 has been widely used to screen for mental health issues and is commonly used to assess the subjective mental health symptoms of college students ([Xie and Dai, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref903)). According to [Ren (2009)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref904), the SCL-90 was used in 63.8% of the published articles regarding the mental health of college students, illustrating its strong validity and reliability. In addition, the Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC) is a widely used self-assessment tool for measuring varying levels of life stress ([Zhao et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821206/full#ref68)).

Up to now, few studies have explored the relationship between growth mindsets, mental health and life events. The purpose of the current study is to explore whether individuals with a growth mindset might have better mental health and life event outcomes than those with a fixed mindset. We hypothesized that: (1) individuals with a growth mindset have better mental health than those with a fixed mindset; (2) individuals with a growth mindset have better self-report life events than those with a fixed mindset; and (3) individual family socioeconomic status will have an effect on growth mindset.
