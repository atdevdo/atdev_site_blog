Undeniably, hiring senior software engineers is hard. However, I don’t buy into the narrative that the market is completely dried out. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with many different engineering teams, which could all be sorted into two categories: The ones struggling to hire seniors and the ones that had an easy time. In fact, the teams in the latter category were usually full.

There are many reasons why some teams fail to attract good talent. But all the teams that have an easy time have realized a simple fact about our current market situation:

**_When hiring senior engineers, the company doesn’t choose the candidate, the candidate chooses the company._**

Or, put more simply:

**_When hiring senior engineers, you’re not buying, you’re selling._**

If you disagree with the above statement, let me put it into perspective. Some years ago, my resume got into a recruiter network. At the time I had about 3 years of experience as a software engineer in smaller companies. For days my inbox was flooded with recruiter emails. Another time, a few years later, I got unsolicited phone calls from three different recruiters in a single day.

This story doesn’t say anything about my abilities as an engineer. Many of my colleagues with various backgrounds and skill levels have similar stories. In the current market situation, an engineer with a few years of experience under their belt has lots and lots of options.

The funny thing is, while I was employed at both those times, I wasn’t particularly happy with my job. I would’ve been interested in new opportunities, but these recruiters did such a bad job at making the offer sound attractive, I declined even meeting any of them in person. So don’t think that senior engineers aren’t interested in your offer, you just have to make it compelling - you have to sell! Most hiring managers and recruiters I’ve talked to tend to agree with this statement. But if you look at what their company is doing when it comes to hiring, their actions don’t match their words.

In fact, almost everything we do in modern recruiting is bad. It’s bad for all parties involved, but especially for the candidate. Let’s look at a few specific areas.

### Your job posting probably sucks

Imagine you’re hiring for a different (non-engineering) position. You have posted your job offer, and now you’ve received more than 200 resumes to read through. How much time would you spend on each individual resume? A minute or two, even less? This is the position a senior engineer is in, when looking for a job.

Your job posting is like a candidate’s resume. They will only spend a few seconds to judge it, and if it doesn’t catch their attention, they’ll leave. Unfortunately, most job postings are awful.

For example, let’s look at an average job posting for a senior engineering position. I went to one of the big job platforms and searched for “Senior Software Engineer”. I picked a random posting and blurred it because I didn’t want to publicly pick on a specific company. The red areas communicate what the employer needs and the green areas communicate what the employer can offer to the candidate.

If you come from a mindset of buying, this is completely fine - you’re saying what you need. But if you come from a mindset of selling, this is insane! You’re used to reading resumes, so imagine how you’d feel about a candidate whose resume is more than 50% information about what they want.

Instead, they’ve probably tried to fill their resume with 100% information about the benefits they can provide for the company. They’ve optimized it to put the most compelling arguments for themselves in the most visible spots.

### It’s probably too hard to find information on your company

Going beyond the job posting, most companies make it really hard to find some vital information about them. Be honest, is it easy to find answers to all the following questions that might be super important to prospective hires? Easy as in, max. one click away from your job posting?
