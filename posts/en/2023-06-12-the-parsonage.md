The spirit life of old urban buildings works like an inversion of the transmigration of souls. A spectral essence is not the constant, as it is with a soul that drifts out of one body to be reincarnated in another. The constant is the containing vessel, the structure on the city street, and the spirit of the place is what changes over time.

Trendy storefronts shutter when the trends pass. The fabric-and-pattern shop where your grandmother got the material to sew her parlor curtains became the hi-fi store where your mom bought the stereo she took to college, and that was converted to a video outlet before the tattoo salon moved in. The rental apartments on the residential floors above, where two generations in a family could once live together, were subdivided into studios for young singles, then sold as condos. Old buildings stand, if they’re not razed for redevelopment, while their functions come and go, and the character of their repurposing provides a connection to the world changing around them — a kind of transient newness that, in its transience, is perpetually renewable.

This cycle of ever-altering uses within a fixed architectural framework — and with it, ever-shifting meanings and associations, as well as fluctuating use value — is a commonplace in cities everywhere, but embodied to an uncommon degree in a singular location in the east half of Greenwich Village in New York City. A four-story townhouse at 64 East 7th Street has the distinction of being central to an unlikely string of important moments in New York history. From the first wave of immigration from Europe to lower Manhattan, through the rise of the Beats and avant-garde performance art in the mid 20th century, to the gentrification of recent years, the same building on East 7th Street has encapsulated one era after another after another.

I had been at the site four or five times before I began to realize its importance. As an undergraduate at New York University in the mid 1970’s, I lived on MacDougal Street and liked to imagine myself as a bohemian intellectual by browsing around what was left of the antiquarian book district, in what then was becoming known as the East Village. I had heard from a musician friend that Patti Smith was spotted in a shop called Books ’N Things on East 7th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenues, a few blocks from CBGB, the punk club. One of the first times I went, I was flipping through a well-preserved old novel — I can’t remember the title — and noticed that it had the name Marguerite Young written neatly on the inside cover: it had come from the personal library of the author of *Miss MacIntosh, My Darling*, who, I learned from the owner, Gertrude Briggs, was a regular at the store. So were the poets Allen Ginsberg and Marianne Moore, Briggs said, and “Lou, the singer in that band” — the Velvet Underground. Unaware that Marianne Moore had died a couple years earlier, I was smitten with the dubious hope of seeing old lions of the Village literati hobnobbing with punks and art-rock stars, and I kept coming back to Books ’N Things looking for Patti Smith and Marguerite Young.

It wasn’t until 2001, in the days after September 11, that I began to learn something of the larger history of the building. Journalists writing about the World Trade Center attacks would sometimes describe 9/11 as the worst loss of life seen in New York City since “the *Slocum* disaster.” I looked it up and learned that the sinking of the steamboat PS *General Slocum* in 1904, a signal event of the early 20th century, was directly connected to 64 East 7th Street.

The outwardly unassuming Greek Revival brownstone was built (with three stories) in 1840, when residential construction was sprouting all around Greenwich Village to support the city’s boom as a mercantile port and textile-manufacturing center. As immigrants arrived from Europe to work on the docks and in the sweatshops, Germans settled in an area between Bond Street and Astor Place that came to be called *Kleindeutschland*. The organization of United German Lutherans built the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Mark on 6th Street, and in 1882, its young pastor, the Rev. George C. F. Haas, made 64 East 7th Street the parsonage. Haas and his extended family — his wife, the former Anna Hansen, along with her mother, his sister, and George and Anna’s two young children — were living in the parsonage when Haas decided to have the church charter an excursion liner to take his congregation on a summer day trip to the North Shore of Long Island for a picnic.

The ship, a sidewheel steamboat named for a general in the Union Army, had three decks constructed of oil-polished pine and white oak, and was large enough to accommodate the nearly 1,400 passengers on board — most of them women and children, because the trip took place on Wednesday, a work day. The *Slocum* launched off a pier on East 3rd Street and churned up the East River until it reached the point called Hell Gate (after the old Dutch word for the river, *Hellegat*) at around 90th Street. There it caught fire, probably from an errant match or cigarette. Fire hoses onboard had rotted, and the cork in the life preservers had fossilized. Passengers who didn’t burn to death drowned, laden with high-laced shoes and layers of Victorian clothing. The Coast Guard estimated that 1,388 people died. Among the casualties were the pastor’s wife Anna, their daughter, and Mrs. Haas’s mother. (The Haases’ son had not gone on the trip.)

A photograph taken outside No. 64 on the day of the funeral for the perished Haases shows oglers craning out windows on East 7th Street and cramming onto the stoops of neighboring buildings. Horse-drawn hearses queue along the block — symbols of the spiritual death of Kleindeutschland and the coming migration of German immigrants from lower Manhattan. A great many of those who suffered through the *Slocum* disaster moved to a neighborhood about four miles north: Yorkville, on the Upper East Side, close to the point in the East River where the ship caught fire.

When the townhouse was sold, in 1913, the buyer converted the lower level for commercial use and added a storefront entrance. The first renter, in 1919, was Alexander Brailovsky, a Russian-born journalist and printer who supported the Communist movement that was just beginning to spread beyond his native country. He set up a stationery store with a print shop in back, and published a broadsheet, *Russky Golo*s (_Voice of Russia_). Two years after the Russian Revolution and three years before the Soviet Union was formalized as a state, Communism was an unfamiliar political abstraction to most Americans, though one appealing to the growing number of freethinkers and nonconformists who were joining the extant Village population of immigrant laborers.

> The tenant in 1919 was a journalist and printer, publisher of a Communist broadsheet and accused bomber of J.P. Morgan Bank on Wall Street.

At one minute past noon on September 16, 1920, an explosion in front of the J.P. Morgan Bank on Wall Street killed 30 people and injured hundreds more in the crowded financial district at lunchtime. (Six of the wounded died soon after.) Investigators would determine that a horse-drawn cart had been carrying about a hundred pounds of dynamite packed with five times that weight in chunks of metal, set with a timer to detonate and hurl destruction. The lethal assault on the seat of the American economy was widely presumed to have been perpetrated by one of the many anticapitalist groups in the news at the time: radical Trotskyites or anarchists or Wobblies or Bolsheviks …. It was the most devastating act of terrorism yet to occur in the U.S.
