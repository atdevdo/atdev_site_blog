## **5 Steps To Help You Find Out What To Do Next In Life**

### **1. Take Time Out**

The first thing you should do, if you don’t know what to do, is do nothing.

Take time out to sit with the unknown.

You don’t have to hide away from the world by going away on a retreat for a month to sort out your life.

But if you can do this, then more power to you!

**Taking time out could mean cutting back on non-essential tasks and activities, freeing up more time each day for you to just ‘be.’**

### **2. Feel Your Emotions**

With a little extra time to yourself, you may find that feelings that were previously hidden away or covered up because you were too busy will surface.

You cannot avoid your emotions (_although many people try by indulging in addictive behaviors_).

When you feel and examine your emotions, you find that they have something to teach you.

You may experience doubt, apathy, or even panic about your future.

Emotions left unattended by the conscious mind, such as anger or frustration, can manifest in your body in a physical form (_e.g. upset stomach_).

Don’t ignore them.

What often keeps people in a state of indecision is fear.

Fear is at the root of many of the so-called [negative emotions](https://everydaypower.com/do-not-avoid-emotional-pain/).

But fear could also be mixed with excitement, hope, and elation.

There is a wide spectrum of emotions to be experienced—feel whatever is arising and know that these will eventually pass.

The more time you spend acknowledging your feelings, the less scary your emotions will seem.
