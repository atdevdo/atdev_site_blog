_Our story … rests within the culture, which is inseparable from the land. To write this is to write of the land and the people who are born from her._

_As a (qu)id \[queer kid], I learned that Kānaka Maoli were not homeless, because Hawaiʻi is our home._—­ Tatiana Kalaniopua Young

## 1. Seeking Refuge

See the child. Brown-skinned, bushy-haired, androgynous. She wakes in the remnants of a World War II-era pillbox. Folds her blanket and stuffs it in a backpack. Breakfast is a handful of Apple Jacks. She checks her phone, scrolling frustratedly. “Where the fuck are you?” No one answers.

So opens Kimi Howl Lee’s *Kamaʻāina: Child of the Land*. [1](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_1 'Read Footnote 1') The 2020 short film follows Mahina, an unsheltered, queer *Kānaka Maoli* (Native Hawaiian) sixteen-year-old as she navigates the familiar yet hostile streets of Waiʻanae on the west side of Oʻahu. In search of shade, Mahina lingers at a Korean barbecue joint, only to be chased off by an employee: “Benches are for customers.” As night falls, we sense her deepening vulnerability — invisible to drivers passing on Farrington Highway, all too visible to men loitering in the park.

In the film’s third act, Mahina makes her way to Waiʻanae harbor, where houseless individuals have built a sprawling encampment of tents, tarps, shopping carts, bike parts, and other found materials, protected by a wall of stacked wood pallets. Mahina is taken to the group’s de facto leader, a tough but tender woman named Aunty Twinkle, who listens as Mahina explains her situation: estranged from her mother, recently kicked out by her girlfriend’s parents. Without hesitation (or red tape), Aunty Twinkle offers Mahina a place to stay in the village. In the film’s final moments, we see Mahina standing on the shore, gazing at a billowing ocean as Aunty Twinkle promises the community’s support: “You need that time, find yourself, go ahead. You need us with you, we will stand with you.”

> Puʻuhonua O Waiʻanae serves as a sanctuary for islanders unable to access conventional forms of shelter — a safety net beneath the safety net.

Lee’s film responds directly to the experiences of queer and trans youth in Hawaiʻi, who are disproportionately represented among the islands’ unsheltered population. [2](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_2 'Read Footnote 2') Most of the cast, including Malia Kamalani Soon, who plays Mahina, and Twinkle Borge, who plays herself, have experienced houselessness. The film was shot on location at Puʻuhonua O Waiʻanae, the real-life settlement that helped inspire the story, which occupies roughly ten acres of state-owned property next to Waiʻanae Small Boat Harbor. In *ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi* (the Hawaiian language), the term *puʻuhonua* describes a place of refuge, a “sanctuary, or asylum, a place of peace and safety.” [3](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_3 'Read Footnote 3') Tatiana Kalaniopua Young, a *māhūwahine* (Native Hawaiian transgender queer woman) and one-time resident of Puʻuhonua O Waiʻanae, writes that “as a refuge, puʻuhonua can be a person, a place, or a thing. Its main function is to create space for inclusion, harmony, protection, and safety.” [4](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_4 'Read Footnote 4')

For more than a decade, Puʻuhonua O Waiʻanae has served as a sanctuary for islanders unable to access conventional forms of shelter — a safety net beneath the safety net. At any given time, the village is home to between 200 and 300 people, the majority of them Native Hawaiian, and a good number of them queer or gender-nonconforming. [5](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_5 'Read Footnote 5') Those who live at the puʻuhonua pay no rent but volunteer their time, running the onsite food pantry or taking shifts as security guards. The village is presided over by Borge, an openly queer Kānaka Maoli woman who has been houseless since 2006. She is known around the island as Aunty Twinkle — or, within the village, as Mamas. A team of mostly female “captains” help manage day-to-day affairs. “Visiting Puʻuhonua O Waiʻanae means entering as a guest into a space with its own unique governance structure led almost entirely by Kānaka Maoli women,” writes Tina Grandinetti, an Oʻahu-born *Uchinaanchu* (Indigenous Okinawan) scholar and activist who spent years studying and writing about Puʻuhonua O Waiʻanae. [6](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_6 'Read Footnote 6')

For residents, Puʻuhonua O Waiʻanae is a reprieve from an economic system that has made housing a luxury good, and from societal norms that marginalize those who do not fit mainstream expectations around gender, sexuality, or family structure. The need for such a refuge is acute. The state of Hawaiʻi consistently reports one of the highest rates of houselessness per capita in the United States, while its homeownership rate is among the lowest. [7](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_7 'Read Footnote 7') On Oʻahu, the most populous of the eight main Hawaiian islands, one of every two renters is cost-burdened, spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. [8](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_8 'Read Footnote 8') In March 2022, the median price of a single-family home on Oʻahu hit $1.15 million, a 21 percent increase from the year before. [9](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_9 'Read Footnote 9') Even before these spikes in costs, the National Low Income Housing Coalition reported that an individual making minimum wage on the island could work around the clock — 168 hours per week — and still be seven hours short of affording the average rent on a two-bedroom apartment. [10](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_10 'Read Footnote 10')

Meanwhile, on Oʻahu alone, 14,000 housing units — more than three times the unhoused population — are unoccupied, reserved as second homes or investment properties. [11](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_11 'Read Footnote 11') Roughly a quarter of all home purchases in Hawaiʻi are by out-of-state buyers, a share that grew in the first half of 2020 as the coronavirus fueled demand for private havens. [12](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_12 'Read Footnote 12') Between 2019 and 2021, the number of home sales to foreign buyers in the state increased by 25 percent, representing $22.2 *billion* in real-estate transactions. [13](https://placesjournal.org/article/puuhonua-o-waianae-housing-honolulu/#ref_13 'Read Footnote 13') Hawaiʻi real-estate executives boasted of sales growth in excess of 300 percent. In December 2021, two days before Christmas, amid a surge of the Omicron variant, the *Wall Street Journal* carried what the editors must have felt was a festive headline: “Since Covid, Hawaii Home Sales Over $10 Million Have Grown Sixfold.”
