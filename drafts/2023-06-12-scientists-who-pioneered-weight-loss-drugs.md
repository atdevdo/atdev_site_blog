The history of weight-loss drugs is littered with failures. Some were outright dangerous: In the 1950s and ’60s, amphetamine-based diet pills were popular, but their prominence faded after being linked to addiction and other severe side effects. In 1997 the drug cocktail fen-phen was removed from the US market after it became clear it caused heart valve damage. Other attempts at treating obesity with drugs hit scientific dead ends. The history of anti-obesity drug discovery is for the most part “a bottomless pit into which people shove money and time,” wrote Derek Lowe in *[Science](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/glp-1-and-obesity)*.

The new crop of much-hyped weight loss drugs seems to be different. These work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which regulates blood sugar levels and slows down the rate at which food leaves the stomach, making people fuller for longer. GLP-1-mimicking drugs seem to be a powerful tool for weight loss: Some people lose 15 percent of their body weight or more after 68 weeks on semaglutide, which is approved in the US for weight loss as Wegovy and for type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic.

But the history of GLP-1 goes back more than 40 years—before obesity became the health crisis it is today. To get a sense of where these drugs came from—and where they might go next—WIRED spoke to two scientists who did some of the earliest work on the GLP-1 hormone, and who have played an important role in the development of these drugs.

Jens Juul Holst is a professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Joel Habener is a professor at the Mass General Research Institute in Massachusetts. In 2021, Habener, Holst, and Daniel Drucker were awarded the [Warren Alpert Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Alpert_Foundation_Prize) Prize for their work discovering and developing treatments based on the GLP-1 hormone.

Holst and Habener were interviewed separately. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

**WIRED: Jens, you got involved with this research in the 1970s. Rather than diabetes or obesity, the history of GLP-1 starts with a completely different disease. Tell us about that.**

**Jens Holst:** This was duodenal ulcer disease—people have forgotten about that disease completely. Diabetes was just something for old people, and you couldn’t do a lot about it anyway, and it was not interesting. So people were talking about duodenal ulcer disease—*that* was the problem.

**And this meant looking at the hormones that are secreted when people eat. You started taking GLP-1 from pigs and** **[pumping it through](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/123/4/2009/2531546?redirectedFrom=fulltext)** **pig pancreases to see what it did—and that’s when you realized GLP-1 seemed to be a particularly powerful hormone.**

**Holst:**  We found that not only did GLP-1 stimulate insulin secretion, it also inhibited glucagon secretion. This was interesting, because people with diabetes have too much glucagon and that glucagon causes high blood sugar. So by stimulating insulin and inhibiting glucagon, you could have a double mechanism on the blood glucose. And now it was beginning to look like something interesting, and we were beginning to think of diabetes.

**That pig pancreas study was published in 1988. Were drug companies paying much attention then?**

**Holst:** I have always had friendly relationships with \[Ozempic and Wegovy manufacturer] Novo Nordisk. It’s in Denmark, just up the street, and we were interested in the same things, so I kept telling them about what we were doing.

They were obviously interested in anything that could stimulate insulin secretion, but I must say that when we showed Novo Nordisk that \[a different but related hormone] does *not* stimulate insulin secretion in people with diabetes, they withdrew some research support we had received because they said it wouldn’t work.

This is true. This is what happened. They were listening politely, but they weren’t really interested.

**But by the early 1990 things started to change?**

**Holst:** The real turning point was a study by [Michael Nauck](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00401145) in 1993. We worked together, and we finally infused GLP-1 into people with type 2 diabetes and could show that the blood glucose came to completely normal levels in four hours, while insulin was stimulated and glucagon was inhibited. This demonstrated to everybody that this was really doing something in people with type 2 diabetes, completely unlike other hormones.

**At that point, did you have a sense of how much potential these drugs might have, for treating obesity as well as diabetes?**

**Holst:** We were finding these things out step by step. First, it was stimulating insulin secretion. That’s interesting but not really exciting. Then it’s stimulating glucagon secretion—that’s more interesting, put that on top. Then it’s also inhibiting the GI tract and gastric emptying.

Then we find out it’s inhibiting food intake as well. Wow, amazing. Amazing. It’s building up on top of each other all the time.

**Joel Habener:** We thought this might be a potential treatment for diabetes, type 2 diabetes. But we and others were finding with treating human subjects with GLP-1 in the very early days that you had to be very careful to keep the dose low, because many patients felt ill when they were eating. They were supposed to eat a meal, and then within 30 minutes we’d measure the blood insulin to check how effective it was.

Many of the subjects noted they were unable to finish their meal. It was messing up the experimental protocol because they were getting full and feeling nauseated and saying they didn’t want to eat any more food. Today, we’re between 10 to 15 percent of adults in the world who have a [BMI at or above 30](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight); in the US it’s around [40 percent](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html). And obesity is clearly a very serious metabolic disease.

**And that means a huge number of people will meet the FDA’s requirements for** **[Wegovy treatment](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014). Some projections put the future value of obesity drugs at** **[$100 billion annually](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-rivals-see-room-compete-100-bln-weight-loss-drug-market-2023-05-04/). Did you ever suspect that your work on GLP-1 could make you rich?**

**Holst:** I’m so old, you know! I’m from ’68 and all of that; I was walking around in the street with signs saying: “Research for the people, not for the profit.” We didn’t even think of patenting or getting money out of this or anything. We were interested in publishing, doing something and moving this ahead.
