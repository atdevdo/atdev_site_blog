If someone in your circle is mentally healthy, there’s an excellent chance that being around him or her will benefit your [mental health](https://everydaypower.com/mental-health-importance-2/) as well.

It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about a date or a mate, a friend, or a colleague.

Emotionally healthy people make light work of relationships and bring out the best in us.

As we all know, the opposite is also true: mentally unhealthy people are challenging to be around, make for rocky associations, and cause us undue agitation.

Of course, someone simply having emotional health will not automatically enhance yours.

For long-term, close relationships, people must have values and personality traits that mesh well.

You know the feeling when reading uplifting quotes on depression or reading short stories from those who have overcome it?

The same stems from your personal conversations.

You can’t go wrong in seeking people who embrace the following qualities, which exemplify good mental health:

## Signs That Someone Is Good for Your Mental Health

### **1. They ask you questions about yourself and listen emphatically to your answers.**

For starters, people need to have [empathy](https://everydaypower.com/compassionate-empathy-quotes/), or the ability to put themselves in someone else’s shoes.

This involves understanding what you’re going through and acknowledging it.

They don’t need to have experienced similar situations or feelings.

In fact, they might react differently than you do in any given situation.

However, they must be able to express recognition of what you’re feeling.

They may move toward understanding by asking appropriate questions and/or by trying to imagine what you’re experiencing.

Empathy is not the same as you describing a frightening experience in Mexico, and a friend relating that she had one in France (_unless you feel that what she’s describing mirrors what you were saying or feeling_).

If someone listens actively, (_i.e. taking in what you’re saying, asking relevant questions to understand your experience_), they probably are exhibiting empathy.

You know this because it makes you feel understood – one of the most wondrous feelings in the world.

### 2. They talk comfortably about their inner world and can be emotionally vulnerable.

Although empathy is important, it’s not enough to enhance your mental health.

You also want someone to be able to share his or her experiences and open up to you.

That’s how people bond.

No matter how understanding someone is, we feel more comfortable around people who express what’s happening inside them.
