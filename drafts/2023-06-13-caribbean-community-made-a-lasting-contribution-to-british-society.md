As a young boy in 1962, I remember arriving in England from Jamaica on a BOAC jet plane. It seemed to me like I was going to the moon – the air hostess who accompanied me was the first white person I had ever seen. My father greeted me eagerly at London’s Paddington station, amid the swirling smoke of steam trains. It had been two years since we last met, but I recognised him immediately.

Fourteen years earlier, the arrival of the [Empire Windrush](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/inspire-me/the-story-of-windrush/) at London’s Tilbury docks in 1948 was a pivotal moment in British history, marking the beginning of a significant wave of migration from the Caribbean. This became known as [the Windrush generation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43782241), and signified a new chapter in the history of the United Kingdom. Since then it has assumed a symbolic status, commemorated annually on [Windrush Day](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/arrival-of-the-empire-windrush-celebrating-the-75th-anniversary/), observed on 22 June.

_This article is part of our [Windrush 75 series](https://theconversation.com/topics/windrush-75-139220?utm_source=TCUK&utm_medium=linkback&utm_campaign=Windrush75&utm_content=InArticleTop), which marks the 75th anniversary of the HMT Empire Windrush arriving in Britain. The stories in this series explore the history and impact of the hundreds of passengers who disembarked to help rebuild after the second world war._

This turning point reformed Anglo-Caribbean identities as the Windrush generation settled in Britain, leaving their mark on history, society and culture. The arrivals serve as a poignant reminder of the dynamic and fluid nature of migration, identity and societal transformation. But how did this momentous event come about, and what were the factors that led to the settlement of these British citizens?

These questions are important because Windrush history is not included in the UK school curriculum, resulting in an incomplete view of Britain’s history of cultural diversity. Race equality think tank, the [Runnymede Trust](https://www.runnymedetrust.org/about/about-us), has described the Windrush story as “[an integral part of British history](https://inews.co.uk/news/education/michael-gove-drop-windrush-generation-national-curriculum-459957)”.

While there are now numerous celebratory events and commemorations on or around Windrush Day, once the festivities end, there is little permanence. There are no major collections or permanent Windrush exhibitions. There has been no museum dedicated to its history with the significance of other major British museums. And there is no major institution for children to view the legacies of the Windrush generation and their impact on Britain. These are just some of the reasons I recently founded the [National Windrush Museum](https://www.nationalwindrushmuseum.com/our-vision).

## Coming to Britain

The British invitation to Caribbeans to come to Britain after the second world war can be traced back to the [British Nationality Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/56/enacted) of 1948. This conferred British citizenship and the right to settle in the UK on all people from the British colonies to help rebuild the country.

The Windrush generation refers to the people who migrated from Caribbean countries to the United Kingdom between 1948 and 1971. However, Caribbean immigration did not cease after this period, and migrants have settled ever since, influencing [Britain’s demographic composition](<https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/bulletins/ethnicgroupenglandandwales/census2021#:%7E:text=In%20England%20the%20percentage%20of,was%204.2%25%20(2.4%20million)>).

Major urban centres like London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Liverpool, Leeds and Preston became focal points for these communities, where they established vibrant neighbourhoods and thriving cultural institutions, contributing to the [overall diversity and multicultural fabric](https://publications.goettingen-research-online.de/bitstream/2/111211/1/ER-2007-Complexities_Cohesion_Britain_CIC.pdf) of these cities.

Despite the open invitation, the reception the Windrush pioneers received was often [hostile](https://theconversation.com/empire-windrush-how-the-bbc-reported-caribbean-migrants-mixed-reception-in-1948-98593). Caribbean migrants were (and still are) subjected to poor housing conditions, with accommodation in hostels often overcrowded and lacking basic amenities. In 1948, an [underground shelter](https://www.mylondon.news/news/nostalgia/incredible-pictures-show-london-underground-22246855) in Clapham South tube station was used as temporary housing for people from the Caribbean.

The types of employment available to the Windrush generation were often limited to [low-paying jobs](https://www.bl.uk/windrush/articles/how-caribbean-migrants-rebuilt-britain) such as cleaning, factory work and driving. Created the same year in 1948, the National Health Service (NHS) has been an [important source of employment](https://peopleshistorynhs.org/the-windrush-generation-and-the-nhs-by-the-numbers/) for members of the Windrush community since its inception.

Many Caribbean migrants found work in hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities, playing a [crucial role](https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/windrush-and-the-nhs-an-entwined-history/) in the development and functioning of the NHS. They contributed their skills, dedication and expertise, helping to shape and improve healthcare provision in the UK.

Some devised ingenious self-help micro-financing schemes such as the [“partners” initiative](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42855610), where small groups banded together and [shared from the combined pot of money](https://www.ft.com/content/7de2eea4-f030-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901) weekly. This is how many of the Windrush generation afforded air fares to send for their families – and how my parents were able to send for me.

The institutional racism and poor conditions endured by the Windrush generation led to people starting their own businesses: barbers and hairdressers, fashion and design, restaurants and cook shops, a variety of trades, market stalls, independent black churches and dancehall music. These businesses were important not just in generating a living, but also in developing flourishing communities and creating black British culture.
