In the small town of Kalna, every pond — or *pukur* in Bangla — tells a story.

_Amlapukur_, a pond near my ancestral home, borrows its name from a row of *amla* trees — Indian gooseberry — that once adorned its banks.

_Mallickpukur_, behind our house, was named for the caste of its owners, and served as habitat for a waddling of domesticated ducks, who noisily asserted their presence in the evenings.

> The pond was once carpeted with Indian lotus, water droplets adorning their leaves like scattered pearls. It used to attract migratory birds.

East of us, massive *Poddopukur* — “Lotus Pond” — was once carpeted with Indian lotus, water droplets adorning their hydrophobic leaves like scattered pearls. The pond used to attract migratory birds, especially the common teal, who rested here on journeys between West Asia and Australia. It also attracted hunters and trappers. Wealthy hunters shot the teals — *baali-haans* in Bangla — for sport, and considered their meager flesh a delicacy. The poorer trappers caught them alive, to be sold in urban markets. The killing and trapping took place at such a scale that, by the 1970s, the teals had vanished, and Poddopukur went quiet.

_Gumropukur_, to the west, evoked a different kind of silence. *Gumro* is a Bangla word meaning pain and anguish bottled up within. This pond, its surface coated with shiny blue-green algae, received the murdered victims of political violence. Everyone avoided it — except for crickets, frogs, and fireflies who made the eerie habitat their home.

To the north, our house faced a smaller pond. Breaking with tradition, it remained nameless.

Bivas Bhattacharjee, *Skeletons of Goddesses*, 2012. Immersion of Hindu idols into waterbodies after worship is integral to cultural life in Bengal. The idols are constructed of straw, rice husk, and jute ropes, held together with mud collected from riverbanks. As water levels drop in summer, the mud is reclaimed by the waters, and skeletal idols emerge – like these in a canal in rural West Bengal. \[Courtesy Bivas Bhattacharjee]

Its right bank was overgrown with taro plants, a natural habitat for monocled cobras. As a boy, I watched as elderly widows, uncared for by their relations and driven by hunger, walked barefoot into the thick growth to forage. Its left bank was hemmed in by mango, coconut, and wood apple trees. In summer, as ripe fruits dropped, we could recognize each by its splash — the short, sharp plonk of a mango; the dull thud of a coconut.

As a child, I almost drowned in this pond. I also learned how to fish in its waters. My rod was a bamboo stick, fitted with nylon string and an iron hook. The float was made of white duck feathers. My mother recalls that every time I caught a fish, I rushed to show her my silver catch, wriggling in my palms and coating them with slime. As evening fell, the call to end my adventures was the sound of fish sizzling in mustard oil.

> The pond, too, has been a victim of vicissitudes. Filth flows freely in, and no one swims in it anymore. I am witnessing the slow erasure of my past.

At the northern end of our nameless pond, the remains of my grandparents’ house sit now behind a row of coconut trees. Time has scraped away plaster, sand, and lime, revealing red bricks once baked from the free soil of a newly independent India. The tin roof has rusted beyond repair, soaking the interiors with rain — and with sunlight.

The pond, too, has been a victim of vicissitudes.

Real-estate encroachment has claimed a third of it. Filth now flows freely in from the surrounding houses, painted pink, blue, and yellow. No one swims in it anymore. I am witnessing the slow erasure of my past.

I belong to a partitioned family.

In the mid-1940s, my grandfather, the late Krishna Kumar Bhadra, set his heart on returning from Lucknow, in India, to his ancestral home in Chittagong, in rural East Bengal. But partition in 1947 placed Chittagong in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and erased any possibility of homecoming.
