## Abstract

Typing has become a pervasive mode of language production worldwide, with keyboards fully integrated in a large part of many daily activities. The bulk of the literature on typing expertise concerns highly trained professional touch-typists, but contemporary typing skills mostly result from unconstrained sustained practice. We measured the typing performance of a large cohort of 1301 university students through an online platform and followed a preregistered plan to analyse performance distributions, practice factors, and cognitive variables. The results suggest that the standard model with a sharp distinction between novice and expert typists may be inaccurate to account for the performance of the current generation of young typists. More generally, this study shows how the mere frequent use of a new tool can lead to the incidental development of high expertise.

## Significance statement

Typing has become a pervasive mode of language production worldwide, with keyboards fully integrated into many daily activities. Many people, including university students, spend several hours a day typing. Such intensive practice may lead to high levels of achievement, perhaps comparable with those that professional typists had before the advent of personal computers, despite the fact that contemporary typing often relies on informal learning and accommodates a greater range of typing habits. Our preregistered study aimed at characterizing the more variable expertise currently prevalent in university students, by combining two complementary approaches to the study of expertise. The first focuses on identifying the habits that are associated with proficient performance. The second focuses on identifying the underlying cognitive processes that might differ between the most and least proficient individuals. The results show that using a keyboard frequently can, by itself, lead to the development of high expertise, and that the difference between the least and the most proficient typists is more quantitative than qualitative. The available database provides a useful benchmark for future experimental research on typing.

## Introduction

The acquisition of typing expertise has seen a radical change in the last two or three decades, going from the formal systematic training of a very limited population of professionals to a variable, often disorderly and unconstrained process carried out by a wide portion of the general population. From the invention of typewriters at the end of the nineteenth century to roughly the end of the 1980s, typewriting was almost exclusively performed by trained professionals. These individuals acquired highly homogeneous skills through intense formal training, which consisted in learning strictly systematic finger-to-key mappings, dispensing from the need to look at their hands while typing, among other requirements. This population of so-called touch-typists has received considerable attention in the scientific literature (e.g. Cooper, [1983](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR11 "Cooper, W. E. (1983). Introduction. In W. E. Cooper (Ed.), Cognitive aspects of skilled typewriting (pp. 1–38). Springer.

                ") ; Gentner, [1983a](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR27 "Gentner, D. R. (1983a). Keystroke timing in transcription typing. In W. E. Cooper (Ed.), Cognitive aspects of skilled typewriting (pp. 95–120). Springer.

                ") ), with much of this research being based on chronometric measures of performance, such as number of words per minute (wpm), response times (RT, the time elapsing between a stimulus and the first keystroke), or inter-keystroke intervals (IKI, time elapsing between two keystrokes).

Since the advent of personal computers and their progressive dissemination from the 1990s onwards, an ever-increasing population has regular access to keyboards. Typing skills have become more widespread but also more variable (Feit et al., [2016](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR22 'Feit, A. M., Weir, D., & Oulasvirta, A. (2016). How we type: Movement strategies and performance in everyday typing. 12.')) as there might be “more than one way to speed up a typist” (Behmer & Crump, [2016](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR3 "Behmer, L. P., Jr., & Crump, M. J. C. (2016). Crunching big data with fingertips: How typists tune their performance toward the statistics of natural language. In M. N. Jones (Ed.), Big data in cognitive science (1st ed., pp. 329–345). Psychology Press.

                ") ). For many typists, high levels of typing performance are achieved through unconstrained sustained practice—or “experience” (Grabowski, [2008](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR30 "Grabowski, J. (2008). The internal structure of university student’s keyboard skills. Journal of Writing Research, 1(1), 27–52.
                  https\://doi.org/10.17239/jowr-2008.01.01.2

                ") ). This is most probably the case in France, for example, where typing is still only alluded to in school curricula (French Ministry of National Education, [2021](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR23 "French Ministry of National Education. (2021). Programmes et horaires à l’école élémentaire. Ministère de l’Education Nationale de la Jeunesse et des Sports.
                  https\://www.education.gouv.fr/programmes-et-horaires-l-ecole-elementaire-9011

                ") ). More generally, the importance given to typing in academic curricula varies substantially across countries; for instance, in the UK, the USA, or Norway, typing is a central aspect of learning to read and write (Genlott & Grönlund, [2013](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR26 "Genlott, A. A., & Grönlund, Å. (2013). Improving literacy skills through learning reading by writing : The iWTR method presented and tested. Computers and Education, 67, 98–104.
                  https\://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2013.03.007

                ") ; Trageton, [2005](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR63 "Trageton, A. (2005).

A thorough assessment is thus required to understand what characterizes the range of typing expertise occurring in the current population of twenty-first century typists. Two complementary perspectives can be taken on this issue (see Fig. [1](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#Fig1)). One focuses on characterizing the habits that lead to, or, minimally, are associated with, proficient typing skills. The other focuses on identifying underlying cognitive processes that might differ between the most and least proficient individuals. Our goal in the current study was to combine these two approaches, in order to determine how various practice habits and cognitive factors are related to the level of achievement in typing (Fig. [1](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#Fig1)).

As an example of the first approach, Keith and Ericsson ([2007](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR35 "Keith, N., & Ericsson, K. A. (2007). A deliberate practice account of typing proficiency in everyday typists. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 13(3), 135–145.
https\://doi.org/10.1037/1076-898X.13.3.135

                ") ) (for a general perspective see Ericsson, [2014](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#ref-CR18 "Ericsson, K. A. (2014). Expertise. Current Biology, 24(11), 508.")) explored the factors determining typing performance in a group of 60 experienced but non-professional intermediate-level typing students. The primary goal of the experiment was to assess the impact of typing habits and general abilities on typing proficiency. Participants' performance was measured in words per minute (wpm) on several tasks involving meaningful or meaningless verbal materials. This indicator of typing skills was regressed on the results of targeted interviews aimed at characterizing past and present typing habits, and of tests aimed at characterizing general cognitive, perceptual, and motor skills. In these data, the most determining factor for performance was a form of deliberate practice, namely training with the general explicit goal of typing fast. The number of keystrokes accumulated since the beginning of practice (i.e. the actual typing experience) also affected performance. In contrast, the individuals' general cognitive, perceptual, and motor skills did not show significant effects in these data (Keith & Ericsson,eresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-022-00424-3#Fig2)).
