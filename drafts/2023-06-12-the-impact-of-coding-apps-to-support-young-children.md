## Introduction

Research shows that quality and intensive early childhood education positively affects children’s learning later in life ([Bers, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B5); [Yu and Roque, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B69)). Consequently, in the past few years, around the globe, countries are introducing computing curricula into their national curriculums to equip pupils with much-needed skills. The development of Computational Thinking skills for young children attract increasing attention ([Strawhacker et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B59)) as a new literacy for the twenty-first century ([Bers, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6)). It is considered an effective way to build thinkers and innovators, engaging children in skills that translate across the disciplines and undoubtedly need them at some point in their lives ([Kazakoff, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B31)). As [Bers (2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6) highlights, coding can be studied as a domain-general problem-solving mechanism and a process that allows users to create shareable products.

Nevertheless, in a world where Moore’s law is picking up its pace, skills in coding would no longer make sense ([Byrd, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B8)) as computational thinking and coding are not only problem-solving process skills. Instead, it is skill sets that provide children with new ways to express themselves, supporting their cognitive, language, and socio-emotional development ([Sullivan et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B61); [Strawhacker et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B59); [Sheehan et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B57)). What is needed now more than ever are not just code wizards, but students who can bring those skills to solve problems, and the only way to answer that is to understand how to identify specific problems, how to communicate effectively, how to problem solve, and think creatively.

The issue presently facing educational technology is not teaching CT and coding in early childhood but selecting developmentally appropriate tools and practices ([Sullivan et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B61); [Hamilton et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B23)). Young children, with their unique developmental needs, need coding environments designed explicitly for them. These must be austere environments that still support multiple combinations, have syntax and grammar, and offer multiple ways to solve a problem ([Bers, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6)). They need to provide opportunities for creating a computational artifact that can be shared with others and support a growing range of computational literacy skills, from beginner to expert ([Bers, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6)). Despite the growing number of apps aiming to get children interested in coding, only a few studies have evaluated these apps’ effectiveness ([Pila et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B44)) in developing children CT skills and fluency.

The present study focuses on how young children (aged seven and under) can engage in Computational Thinking and Computational Fluency (CF) using new programming interfaces such as mobile applications (apps). This paper presents a literature review (*N* = 21) of empirical studies on applying coding apps to support young children’s CT and CF learning. The paper is organized as follows: the introduction part is followed by the theoretical framework of CT and CF. Method and research questions follow the theoretical framework. Findings on the learning effects and researchers’ perspectives on the apps are reported in subsequent chapters.

### Computational Thinking and Computational Fluency

Nowadays, computation is a fundamental part of human existence; children grow up surrounded by technology, CT and coding are considered abilities essential to every child growing up in the 21st century ([Ching et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B9)). Teaching CT to young learners’ is not a new idea; it dates to 1980 ([Papert, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B42)). The Logo turtle robot and Slot Machines are two of the earliest best-known attempts to support children to explore computational thinking ([Clarke-Midura et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B11)). Nevertheless, it gained popularity in the context of education when Jeannette Wing wrote that “to reading, writing, and arithmetic, we should add computational thinking to every child’s analytical ability” ([Wing, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B68), *p*.33). This popularity has led governments, researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders worldwide to propose computing in compulsory education ([Rose, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B56); [Rehmat et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B47); [Tikva and Tambouris, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B65)). This topic has been the subject of attention even across international organizations such as the OECD and UNESCO, recognizing CT and coding as essential competencies required to meet future requirements for a successful life ([Falloon, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B15)). In this context, new initiatives to introduce computing literacy to citizens have been undertaken worldwide from companies, universities, and non-profits such as the Hour of Code, EU Code Week, CS Education Week, and CS for All. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and other leading technology figures promote learning to code as a basis for overall development, gave the same importance as reading, writing, and arithmetic ([Walsh and Campbell, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B66)).

CT can be considered a general problem-solving framework involving knowledge, skills, or solving problems approaches and coding to support these concepts and tasks ([Brennan and Resnick, 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B7); [Ching et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B9); [Bers, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B5); [Rose, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B56)). These include sequences, conditionals, operators, and variables and an understanding of triggers, events, and parallelism ([Falloon, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B15); [Nouri et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B40)). CT and programming’s relationship can be described as follows: “programming supports CT’s development while CT provides to programming a new upgraded role” ([Tikva and Tambouris, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B65), *p*.7).

It is well established that young children spend a substantial amount of time with touchscreens devices ([Dore and Dynia, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B12); [Galway et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B19); [Pila et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B44)) and that they can handle these devices as young as 18 months old, often before reading ([Rose, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B56)). Touchscreen technology has reduced the children’s necessity of performing tasks with a computer, which was a challenging task for young children with limited fine motor skills. Furthermore, object-oriented, “drag and drop” apps have removed much of the code development complexity inherent in traditional text programming languages engaging teachers and students in purposeful activities and conversations and helping students better understand CT concepts. Findings prove that coding apps may be an ideal tool to introduce young age children to coding activities even before entering formal schooling ([Sullivan et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B61); [Sheehan et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B57)). It is essential to mention that physical coding toys/approaches are more engaging for young children and have huge educational potentials (see [Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#F1)) ([Hamilton et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B23)).

**FIGURE 1**. A categorization of computational kits and toys appropriate for young age children based on their physical features (Adapted by [Yu and Roque, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B69)).

Although there are many programming tools in apps ([Ehsan, Beebe and Cardella, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B13)), most of them are not designed for young age students. It is not enough to copy models of computer science education developed for elementary, middle, and or high school students, which are not developmentally appropriate for young children ([Bers, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6)). Some coding apps rely heavily on words, while others mask programming actions, thus obscuring critical aspects of creating coding ([Kazakoff, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B31)). Text-based programming languages are not considered developmentally appropriate for children aged 5–7, an age group that includes pre-readers (0–5) and emergent readers (6–7) ([Sullivan and Bers, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B60); [Pelánek and Effenberger, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B43)). On the contrary, there is evidence to suggest that young children can learn coding at a young age when given developmentally appropriate tools, which support open-ended play and reduce the cognitive effort in a fun and enjoyable way ([Murcia et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B39)). A developmentally appropriate educational approach must be consistent with the children’s needs and embrace their maturational stages by combining play, discovery, socialization, and creativity ([Bers, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B5)). Since 2009 Resnick and his colleagues proposed that programming environments must be characterized by “low floors, high ceilings, and wide walls” ([Resnick et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B50)).

Many researchers also claim that coding in early childhood should not consider a set of technical skills but a new type of literacy and self-expression, which students need to function effectively in the 21st century; a new way for people to organize, share their ideas and express themselves ([Resnick, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B52)). Seymour Papert’s computational thinking involved problem-solving and the notion of expression ([Bers, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6)). [Byrd. (2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B8) mentions that what is needed now more than ever is the ability to use technology to solve problems, and the only way to answer that is to understand how to model problems, think critically, communicate effectively, and solve problems creatively.

Individuals become technologically fluent when they can use technology to express themselves creatively, in a fluent way, effortlessly, and smoothly, as one does with language ([Bers, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6)). For the reasons mentioned, researchers such as [Resnick. (2017)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B52) and [Bers. (2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6) state that it is better to focus on computational fluency than computational thinking. For Resnick, computational fluency involves understanding computational concepts and problem-solving strategies and creating and expressing oneself with digital technologies. Mitchel Resnick states ([Kamenetz, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B29)), “If you have kids put blocks together to solve the puzzle, which can help learn basic computing concepts. Nevertheless, we think it is missing an essential part of what is exciting about coding. If you present just logic puzzles, it is like teaching them writing by only teaching grammar and punctuation. In terms of textual literacy, it would be like only giving children crossword puzzles to solve and expecting them to become fluent writers.” Thus, if computational thinking is to be defined as a process of problem-solving, expression, and creation, we need to provide tools that enable creating an external artifact ([Bers, 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B6)).

In many introductory coding activities, students are asked to code step by step the movements to navigate a virtual character through a maze toward a goal. This approach is designed to help students learn basic science concepts, but it does not allow them to express themselves creatively, developing imagination, curiosity, and a long-term engagement with coding ([Resnick and Siegel, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B49)). Well-designed coding apps must provide an interface that enables users to think creatively, promote problem-solving, and often work collaboratively to create or improve their projects ([Hutchison et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B25)). [Resnick (2003)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B51) states that computer science is well-suited for early childhood education as it provides a positive and effective learning environment where young children can “play to learn while learning to play” ([Resnick, 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B51), *p*.1), promoting a coding playground and not a coding playpen ([Bers et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B3)). A playpen is an environment that provides children with limited opportunities to explore ([Resnick, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B52)). The coding playground promotes open-ended exploration opportunities, creating personally meaningful projects, imagination, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and collaboration. The coding playground engages children in six behaviors that we can also find in the regular playground: content creation, creativity, choices of conduct, communication, collaboration, and community building ([Bers, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B4)). Similarly, [Román-González et al. (2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B53) extend the concept of CT to include various soft skills such as effective communication, decision making, self-confidence, creativity, and teamwork.

All coding apps available in the two biggest app stores claim that they have value as educational tools, but their value is undetermined. To date, there has been little empirical research on the effectiveness of these apps in introducing computational thinking and computational fluency in young children ([Sheehan et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B57)). Many of these apps have never been evaluated in young children, so their claims cannot be confirmed ([Giannakoulas and Xinogalos, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B20); [Terzopoulos et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B62)). More research is needed to determine whether the various coding apps facilitate CT and CF in young children ([Pila et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B44); [Sheehan et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B57); [Hamilton et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B23)). This study fills the knowledge gap in the existing literature by providing vital evidence to inform decisions about the available coding apps’ appropriateness on developing CT and CF for young children.

## Methods

### Research Goal and Questions

This review aims to synthesize research on the impacts of using coding apps on Computational Thinking and Computational Fluency of young children. The Goal, Question, Metrics (GQM) approach was adopted as it stands for a systematic approach for defining and evaluating a set of stated operational goals using measurements. Applying the GQM involves 1) developing a set of research goals, 2) generating questions that define those goals, 3) specifying the types of data to be collected, 4) developing methods for data collection, 5) collecting, validating and analyzing the data to assess the goals and make recommendations for improvement ([Basili, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B2), *p*.4). According to the Goal-Question-Metric approach ([Basili, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B2)), the present study investigates coding apps’ educational value in developing young children’s Computational Thinking and Computational Fluency. Two research questions were formulated to achieve this goal based on the author’s experience and relevant literature ([Laporte and Zaman, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B35); [Fessakis et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B17); [Jin and Zha, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B26); [Terzopoulos et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B62); [Yu and Roque, 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B70)). More specifically, the following research question was identified:

— RQ1: How do coding apps affect the development of Computational Thinking of young age students?

— RQ2: How do coding apps affect the development of Computational Fluency of young age students?

### Research Methodology

A protocol following method guidelines by [Kitchenham. (2004)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#B34) is reported in line with the PRISMA statement in three phases: planning, conducting, and reporting the review. These involve developing the review protocol, defining inclusion and exclusion criteria, searching for relevant literature, critical appraisal, data extraction, and data synthesis. The identification, assessment, and selection of articles for inclusion are shown in the PRISMA flow diagram ([Figure 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.657895/full#F2)).
