If you were a member of the RV social site called RVillage, you may be one of the many who are disappointed that the site has shut down. One of the little touches that I really liked in RVillage was checking into RV parks as we traveled and having RVillage automatically track our locations on a map.

I signed in to the service during the last week it was open and noticed a way to get my data for that map. They sent me a .csv file with all the locations and that was easy to put into a Google MyMap to get the image above. If you had lots of locations logged in RVillage, you can do the same. Hereâ€™s how:

* RVillage was owned by Roadpass.com, and they still respond to emails regarding RVillage.
* Send an email to Support@Roadpass.com
* Tell them your user name in RVillage and ask that they export your places map data and send you a .csv file
* It may take a few days, but you should receive a .csv file from them along with instructions on how to import that into MyMaps to create a map like mine above.
